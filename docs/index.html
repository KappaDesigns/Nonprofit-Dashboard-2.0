        <article><h1>Nonprofit-Dashboard-2.0</h1><p>An Administration and Maintance Pannel for Nonprofits.</p>
<h1>For Those Interested In What This Project Is.</h1><p>For many small nonprofit owners it is difficult to manage many different aspects of the modern technological world. The modern world demands that companies
maintain websites, social media accounts, and many other minute details that increase the presence of a company. For small nonprofits it is difficult to maintain
a website without the assitance of a tech team. Tech teams cost a lot as well all know and not all nonprofits can afford them. The goal of this project, which will
help to accomplish our mission - see http://kappadesigns.org for more - because it eases the maintance of websites. The predecessor of this project was the very first
project I wrote in Node during Sophmore year of high school. Now, I am to redesign the original concept of this dashboard, which allows for google doc style editing of
webpages, creating events, updating blog posts, and many other standard website management functions, while building in specific plugins for certain nonprofits. The community
we hope to build around this project are other developers involved in nonprofits who can help to suggest features that would make it easier for dev teams to maintain
their websites, as well as creating some ease of access for non-tech employees to manage and navigate their websites and other data pertaining to their site. Thank you for
stopping by and reading up on our labor of love!</p>

<p>P.S: Feel free to read our notes file in the root of the project if anyone is interested in a really skimmpy description of what was running through my mind at 2am
when starting to design this project</p>
