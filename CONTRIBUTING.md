# Contributing
At the moment we are mostly looking for any ideas as to what development teams would be looking for that fit that described in the readme.
If you do happen to be one of the small nonprofit dev-teams hit us up with some features you would like to see!
We would love to hear your voices and start up a discussion with you all. 
If you do have any suggestions feel free to share them with us via email, kappadesignsco@gmail.com, or by raising an issue!
Soon we will hopefully have more mediums for communication such as a slack or discord or chat room. Anyways thank you for stopping by
and digging in to the labor of our humble nonprofit, hopefully some great discussion can come about!
