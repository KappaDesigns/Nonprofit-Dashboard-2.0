#How To Format An Issue
0. ENSURE THAT OUR ISSUE ISN'T A DUPLICATE I KNOW ITS HARD FOLKS BUT IT WILL SAVE ALL OF US TIME!!!
1. Post environment variables
2. Explain the context of the issue and what lead up to the issue
3. Is the bug reproducable? If so what are the steps to reproduce it?

Our team will try to get to you as soon as possible, however, our team is two high school Juniors. 
Keeping this in the back of our minds responses from us will not come until after school hours, during lunch or on weekends. 
Thanks for being patient with the student life :D
